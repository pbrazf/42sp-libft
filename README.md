# libft

`libft` is a custom C library developed as part of the 42 São Paulo curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to recreate essential functions from the C standard library, building a solid foundation in low-level programming, memory management, and code organization.

## 📚 Implemented Functions
The library includes functions from the following categories:

- **Libc functions** (e.g. `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_strncmp`)
- **String manipulation**
- **Memory handling**
- **Character checks and conversions**
- **Linked list utilities** (bonus)

All functions are implemented from scratch, without using forbidden standard library calls.

## 🛠️ Compilation
To compile the library, run:

```bash
make
